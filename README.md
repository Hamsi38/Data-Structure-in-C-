# Data-Structure-in-C-

This project focuses on the implementation of various fundamental data structures in the C programming language. The goal is to provide efficient, modular, and well-documented code that can be used as a reference for both beginners and experienced programmers. Through this project, I aim to improve my understanding of data structures, their underlying algorithms, and their practical applications in solving real-world problems.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
	•	Practice and strengthen my C programming skills by implementing key data structures from scratch.
	•	Enhance my understanding of algorithmic efficiency by working with different data structures and analyzing their time and space complexities.
	•	Create a reference for students and learners to better understand how these data structures are constructed and used in C.

Scope

This project covers a wide range of data structures, including but not limited to:
	•	Linear structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
	•	Non-linear structures: Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees) and Graphs.
	•	Hashing: Implementing Hash Tables with collision handling.

Each data structure is implemented with a focus on clarity and efficiency. You’ll find explanations, sample usages, and edge cases for each data structure to better understand how they work.

Learning Objectives

By working on this project, I aim to:
	•	Build a strong foundation in data structure theory and its real-world applications.
	•	Learn how to solve complex problems by choosing the right data structure for each situation.
	•	Sharpen my skills in algorithm analysis (Big O notation) and memory management in C.

Future Work

The project is still a work in progress, and I plan to continuously improve it by:
	•	Adding more advanced data structures like tries, red-black trees, etc.
	•	Enhancing the existing implementations with additional features.
	•	Conducting performance analysis to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
